The method uses mutual information of two random variables to identify genes that are co-expressed, then applies the data processing inequality to filter out interactions that are likely to be indirect. This eliminates the vast majority of false-positive transcriptional interactions typically inferred by pairwise gene-expression correlation analysis. This tool could be used by researchers to determine novel driver genes and drug mechanisms of action.</p>",

Similarly, researchers can search for a measure and see attributes of that measure (e.g., definition, target population, author, reliability, validity), including the associated construct. GEM also allows researchers to add new information using Web 2.0 functionality. Based upon a \"wiki” platform, researchers help build the website by adding and editing measures and constructs and providing feedback and ratings. Researchers can also receive usage statistics about measures to help decide which measure to use in prospective research.</p>",

Splice site mutations in cancer are most frequently observed as inactivating alterations in tumor suppressor genes (e.g., <em>TP53</em> or <em>RB1</em>) and to a lesser degree as activating alterations in oncogenes (e.g., <em>MET</em>). Interpreting the consequences of a specific splice site variant is not straightforward, especially if the variant is located outside of the canonical splice sites. Accurate interpretation of a splice site mutation’s impact can further our understanding of biology, influence patient treatment, and in case of germline splice site variants, may have relevance to familial disease predisposition. To facilitate the interpretation of splice site variant effects, the Biometric Research Program’s Computational and Systems Biology Branch developed MutSpliceDB: a database of splice sites variants, documenting variants effect(s) on splicing based on RNA-seq BAM files from sample(s) with splice site variants.</p>",

This publicly searchable database includes information about biospecimen banks and sample procurement services. The specimens and samples come from non-commercial, NCI- or non-NCI-funded resources. Investigators can search the database and gain access to thousands of specimens of various tumor, organ, and preservation methods. In the event a user is unsuccessful in finding the appropriate specimen resource, he or she may contact the NCI Tissue Expediter, a scientist who can further assist them. Also, the Tissue Expediter can assist researchers to identify potential collaborators when needed.
