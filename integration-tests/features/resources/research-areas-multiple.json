ACT24 has been validated in studies of middle-aged and older adults and has been used to provide detailed portraits of human time use and energy expenditure at the population level. Researchers can register their projects, generate custom logins for participants to enter data via a secure participant site, and download data. An Application Programming Interface (API) is available to link ACT24 data to study management systems.</p>",

These models can then project future trends and help determine optimal cancer control strategies. These models can also be used to guide public health research and priorities. Established in 2000, CISNET comprises nine cancer site groups: breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, cervical, gastric, uterine, bladder, and multiple myeloma. Many of the resources generated by the CISNET consortium are freely available on the website. Additionally, CISNET invites inquiries from outside groups regarding collaborations on cancer control issues that are amenable to modeling.</p>",
