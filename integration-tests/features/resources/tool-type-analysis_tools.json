For human tumor data, the Variant Call Format (VCF) files generated by the variant-calling pipeline can be filtered and annotated using the somatic mutation annotation tools ANNOVAR or SnpEff to provide gene annotation,  an functional annotation , along with predicted effects of non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants calculated by SIFT and Polyphen-2.
