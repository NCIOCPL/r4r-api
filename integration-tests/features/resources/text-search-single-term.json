There are about 150,000 fractions in the initial set, and the fractions are provided in a set of 428 384-well plates. Each sample is provided in the amount of 10 micrograms in a volume of 2 microliters (5 mg/ml) dissolved in DMSO. The fractions are mixtures of natural compounds from plants, marine organisms, and microbes purified by reversed-phase chromatography to provide fractions with better assay performance and simpler subsequent compound isolation. The NPNPD fraction library is expected to grow to a total size of around 1,000,000 fractions by 2024. New sets of fractions will be available each year. Fractions are provided free to laboratories for screening against all disease states. Recipients will be expected to pay for the cost of shipping.</p>",
