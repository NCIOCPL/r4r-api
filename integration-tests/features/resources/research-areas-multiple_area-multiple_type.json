It also establishes and cryopreserves cell lines and other material from these pedigrees (both affected patients and their clinically unaffected siblings), including Epstein-Barr transformed peripheral blood B lymphocytes, primary skin fibroblasts, immortalized skin fibroblasts, WRN cDNA constructs, and others.
