ACT24 has been validated in studies of middle-aged and older adults and has been used to provide detailed portraits of human time use and energy expenditure at the population level. Researchers can register their projects, generate custom logins for participants to enter data via a secure participant site, and download data. An Application Programming Interface (API) is available to link ACT24 data to study management systems.</p>",

The user specifies the number of strata and the prior probability that the drug is active in any particular stratum. Also, since in general there would be uncertainty on whether these strata are completely correlated or independent with regard to the distribution of drug activity, the user also specifies a prior probability corresponding to correlation of drug activity among strata. The more general situation where there are asymmetries among the strata with regard to the prior probability of drug activity will be implemented in the next version of this application.</p>",

A variable can take its value directly from the data file or it can be defined in terms of other variables in the library. Typically, the user will create a separate library for each data file that he or she uses. A library can be saved to disk, then loaded whenever the corresponding data file is used.\nOnce a library of variables has been created (or loaded from removable media), the user may define a model. IRAP supports six data sampling methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple Random Sampling</li>\n<li>Stratified Random Sampling</li>\n<li>Frequency Matching</li>\n<li>Individual Matching</li>\n<li>Cohort Analysis</li>\n<li>Cross-Sectional Analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After choosing the appropriate sampling method, the user defines a model by specifying the appropriate variable names. A model can contain both discrete and continuous variables. IRAP correctly parameterizes the discrete variables, so the user need not explicitly create \"dummy variables.\"\nOnce the model has been specified, the user tells IRAP to fit the model. The program asks for the names of the input and output files. It then reads the data and fits the model.\nWhile these three phases are conceptually distinct, they can be interwoven. For example, after fitting a model, the user may decide to combine two levels of exposure into one. It is easy to define a new variable, then rerun the model, substituting the new exposure variable for the old.</p>",

The questionnaire is available in English and Spanish. C-TUQ was designed and validated by the NCI-American Association of Cancer Research Cancer Patient Tobacco Use Assessment Task Force.
