            "body": "<p>ARACNe uses microarray expression profiles to reconstruct tissue-specific gene regulatory transcriptional interactions in cellular networks. The method uses mutual information of two random variables to identify genes that are co-expressed, then applies the data processing inequality to filter out interactions that are likely to be indirect. This eliminates the vast majority of false-positive transcriptional interactions typically inferred by pairwise gene-expression correlation analysis. This tool could be used by researchers to determine novel driver genes and drug mechanisms of action.<\/p>",

D3Oncoprint also includes curated gene lists to explore commonly investigated biological processes (e.g., BioCarta pathways, FoundationOne cancer panels). Our software provides a flexible environment to dynamically explore the variant mutation profiles provided as input. The focus on interactive visualization with biological and medical annotation significantly lowers the barriers between complex genomic data biomedical investigators. We hope that this resource provides an important means of empowering researchers to translate the information from the collected data sets to biological insights and clinical applications.<\/p>",
