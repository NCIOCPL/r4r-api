            "body": "<p>ARACNe uses microarray expression profiles to reconstruct tissue-specific gene regulatory transcriptional interactions in cellular networks. The method uses mutual information of two random variables to identify genes that are co-expressed, then applies the data processing inequality to filter out interactions that are likely to be indirect. This eliminates the vast majority of false-positive transcriptional interactions typically inferred by pairwise gene-expression correlation analysis. This tool could be used by researchers to determine novel driver genes and drug mechanisms of action.<\/p>",

The success of GTEx depends on the ability to successfully procure and store high quality biospecimens for analysis. Successful collection of normal human biospecimens from rapid autopsies and organ donors requires complex operations and a stringent quality assurance and control process.
