The SPL standard specifies use of some 42 sets of controlled terminology.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Unique Ingredient Identifier (UNII) codes are being developed by FDA to uniquely identify all ingredients used in marketed medications in the United States, as well as substances in biologics, foods, and devices.
