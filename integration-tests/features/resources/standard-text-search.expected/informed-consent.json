FDA terminology subsets are available in each of these four main areas in Excel and text formats:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Structured Product Labeling (SPL) is a document markup standard approved by Health Level Seven (HL7). The SPL standard specifies use of some 42 sets of controlled terminology.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Unique Ingredient Identifier (UNII) codes are being developed by FDA to uniquely identify all ingredients used in marketed medications in the United States, as well as substances in biologics, foods, and devices. Each UNII is assigned based on molecular structure or other immutable characteristics. FDA provides a full set of published UNII codes and a search page on a website now hosted by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and updated approximately monthly.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) terminology is used to encode adverse event information for reporting purposes. Fourteen ICSR term sets are maintained.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Event Problem Code terminology was developed by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) for reporting of medical device problems. Six CDRH term sets, covering Patient Problem Codes, Device Problem Codes, Device Component Codes, Medical Evaluation Conclusions, Medical Device Evaluation Methods, and Medical Device Evaluation Results are maintained.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) terminology was developed by CDRH to represent the attributes found in the GUDID, a repository of key device identification information related to a device's Unique Device Identifier (UDI). Labelers wanting to submit their device information using SPL format (and the FDA Electronic Submissions Gateway) will find all necessary codes in this terminology. Through use of the shared document standard, the GUDID terminology may share some codes with the SPL terminology listed separately on this page, but the SPL terminology does not contain all necessary device-related terms for GUDID.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>",
