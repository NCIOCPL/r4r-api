ACT24 has been validated in studies of middle-aged and older adults and has been used to provide detailed portraits of human time use and energy expenditure at the population level. Researchers can register their projects, generate custom logins for participants to enter data via a secure participant site, and download data. An Application Programming Interface (API) is available to link ACT24 data to study management systems.<\/p>",
