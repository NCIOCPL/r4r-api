Variant-calling analysis can be conducted on both aligned RNA-Seq and DNA-Seq data using Samtools or GATK  Best-Practices pipeline tools. For human tumor data, the Variant Call Format (VCF) files generated by the variant-calling pipeline can be filtered and annotated using the somatic mutation annotation tools ANNOVAR or SnpEff to provide gene annotation,  an functional annotation , along with predicted effects of non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants calculated by SIFT and Polyphen-2. Additionally, for RNA-Seq data, gene-level raw count data files can be generated using HTSeq. The raw count data can be read into BRB-ArrayTools for gene expression analysis.<\/p>",
