D3Oncoprint also includes curated gene lists to explore commonly investigated biological processes (e.g., BioCarta pathways, FoundationOne cancer panels). Our software provides a flexible environment to dynamically explore the variant mutation profiles provided as input. The focus on interactive visualization with biological and medical annotation significantly lowers the barriers between complex genomic data biomedical investigators.
