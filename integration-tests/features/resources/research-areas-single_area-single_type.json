            "body": "<p>ARACNe uses microarray expression profiles to reconstruct tissue-specific gene regulatory transcriptional interactions in cellular networks. The method uses mutual information of two random variables to identify genes that are co-expressed, then applies the data processing inequality to filter out interactions that are likely to be indirect. This eliminates the vast majority of false-positive transcriptional interactions typically inferred by pairwise gene-expression correlation analysis. This tool could be used by researchers to determine novel driver genes and drug mechanisms of action.</p>",
