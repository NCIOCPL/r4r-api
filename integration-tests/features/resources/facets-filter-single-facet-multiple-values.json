ACT24 has been validated in studies of middle-aged and older adults and has been used to provide detailed portraits of human time use and energy expenditure at the population level. Researchers can register their projects, generate custom logins for participants to enter data via a secure participant site, and download data. An Application Programming Interface (API) is available to link ACT24 data to study management systems.</p>",

These models can then project future trends and help determine optimal cancer control strategies. These models can also be used to guide public health research and priorities. Established in 2000, CISNET comprises nine cancer site groups: breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, cervical, gastric, uterine, bladder, and multiple myeloma. Many of the resources generated by the CISNET consortium are freely available on the website. Additionally, CISNET invites inquiries from outside groups regarding collaborations on cancer control issues that are amenable to modeling.</p>",

Furthermore, mRNA expression does not constitute a reliable predictor of protein activity, as it fails to capture a variety of post-transcriptional and post-translational events that are involved in its modulation. To negate this problem, MARINa uses the transcriptional targets of each TF as a multiplexed reporter assay to infer the TFs controlling the transition between cellular phenotypes. This task is performed by computing the effect that enrichment of each regulon (i.e., its activated and repressed targets) has on the differentially expressed genes between two phenotypic states.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Splice site variants are one of the well-known classes of genetic alterations playing an important role in biology. Splice site mutations in cancer are most frequently observed as inactivating alterations in tumor suppressor genes (e.g., <em>TP53</em> or <em>RB1</em>) and to a lesser degree as activating alterations in oncogenes (e.g., <em>MET</em>). Interpreting the consequences of a specific splice site variant is not straightforward, especially if the variant is located outside of the canonical splice sites. Accurate interpretation of a splice site mutation’s impact can further our understanding of biology, influence patient treatment, and in case of germline splice site variants, may have relevance to familial disease predisposition. To facilitate the interpretation of splice site variant effects, the Biometric Research Program’s Computational and Systems Biology Branch developed MutSpliceDB: a database of splice sites variants, documenting variants effect(s) on splicing based on RNA-seq BAM files from sample(s) with splice site variants.</p>",

Each sample is provided in the amount of 10 micrograms in a volume of 2 microliters (5 mg/ml) dissolved in DMSO. The fractions are mixtures of natural compounds from plants, marine organisms, and microbes purified by reversed-phase chromatography to provide fractions with better assay performance and simpler subsequent compound isolation. The NPNPD fraction library is expected to grow to a total size of around 1,000,000 fractions by 2024. New sets of fractions will be available each year.

For both RNAi and CRISPR, multiple shRNAs or sgRNAs (respectively) are used to target a single gene. ScreenBEAM analyzes gene-level activity for the whole set of shRNAs or sgRNAs targeting the same gene (multi-probe analysis) instead of analyzing the effect of each individual shRNA or sgRNA on a given gene. This reduces false positive and negative rates of high-throughput RNAi or CRISPR screens. This algorithm can handle both microarray and next generation sequencing data as input.</p>",

In each cycle, TUS-CPS collects nationally representative data from about 240,000 adults (data collected between 1992-2006 also included youth ages 15-17). About two-thirds of respondents complete the questionnaire by telephone and responses for the remaining third are obtained through in-person interviews. The survey is regularly conducted in English and Spanish, and other languages when needed. These data can be used by researchers to monitor tobacco control progress, conduct tobacco-related research, including tobacco health disparities, and evaluate tobacco control programs.</p>",
